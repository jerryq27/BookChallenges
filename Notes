Abstract Classes
----------------
Abstract classes are meant to be super classes for other classes.
They hold the general information, while subclasses hold the specific information.

Abstract classes are classes not meant to be instantiated, but extended to. 
They can have fields, constructors, and methods like a normal class, but 
they can also have abstract methods (methods with no body) in which a class 
that extends it must override.

A class can also have an abstract method, but once it dos, it can no longer
be instantiated, essentially, the class becomes an abstract class. 

A subclass can still be instantiated with specifying the super abstract class
first when creating a new object.
